After completing the course, students will be able to categorise basic functions and selected aspects of healthcare systems internationally and compare the different framework conditions. Furthermore, students will deepen their ability to present scientific hypotheses, results and discourses in a pointed manner and to critically scrutinise them. Students also learn how to apply scientific findings in healthcare management in possible future professional fields.
