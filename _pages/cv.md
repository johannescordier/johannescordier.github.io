Projects 
======

Hospital Resource Optimization with Causal ML and Reinforcement Learning  
*Keywords: Healthcare | Causal Machine Learning | Reinforcement Learning | Operations Research | Resource Allocation*  
Designed and implemented causal machine learning and offline reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize hospital decision making and patient flow. Projects included optimizing surgery scheduling, patient mobilization, normal care unit allocation, and intensive care discharge decisions. Leveraged high-dimensional patient-level and operational data from German and Swiss hospitals to model bottlenecks and predict demand surges. Developed decision support tools in Python and R, integrating advanced ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and collaborating closely with hospital IT and management. These solutions demonstrate the transferability of advanced analytics and optimization methods to real-world healthcare operations and other resource-constrained industries.

Unlabeled Data Learning for Improving Health Administrative Data Quality  
*Keywords: Health Insurance | Positive-Unlabeled Learning | Data Quality | Unsupervised Learning | Claims Data*  
Developed and implemented positive-unlabeled learning and unsupervised learning methods to enhance the quality of health administrative data. Addressed the challenge of diagnoses and treatments being only positively labeled, leading to substantial missingness for certain conditions and procedures. Built scalable data pipelines in Python to identify and correct label gaps, improving downstream analytics and reporting for insurers and healthcare providers. This work highlights advanced skills in data preprocessing, unsupervised ML, and the practical improvement of real-world health data assets.

Representation Learning of Claims Items  
*Keywords: Health Economics | Deep Learning | Embeddings | Claims Data | Feature Engineering*  
Engineered and trained deep learning models to generate dense vector representations of medical claims items, enabling improved feature extraction for predictive modeling and policy analysis. Leveraged large, heterogeneous claims datasets from Swiss insurers, applying PyTorch and TensorFlow for model development. Used NLP-inspired methods (word2vec, transformer-based models) to build representations for over 70,000 unique claims items, and evaluated embeddings with boosting methods (XGBoost, WarpGBM for CUDA, LSTM). This approach supports transferability to other domains requiring structured data representation and advanced analytics.
